Chapter 36: I/o
CPU is attached to the main memory of the system of the system via
    some kind of memory bus or interconnect. Some of the devices are 
    to the system via a general I/O bus, which in modern systems are 
    call PCI graphics and some other high preformance I/O devices might 
    be found there 
Lower down are one or more of peripheral bus, such as SCSI, Sata, or USB
    USB devices include disks, mouse, or keyboard these are slow 

We need heirarchical structures simply for physics and cost. The faster a
    bus is the shorter is must be, thus a high performance memory bus doe
    not have much room to plug devices into 

Engineering a bus for high performance is costly so a hierarchical 
    approach where components that demand high performance (liek 
    graphics) cards are closer to the CPU. lower performance are 
    farther away
