SJF/STCF - Shortest Job First, or Shortest to completion first.
   This checks the process times and prioritizes the shortest one. It checks everytime a new 
   process starts 

Round Robin - Each job/process takes turns until complete. (fastest response time)
(Normally a very small value such as 1)   
   Each processes gets a turn to run and then it jumps to the next one.

FCFS - First come first serve. (Runs in the order of arrival)
   Each process arrices to que and finishes then moves to next one 

MLFQ - multi-level frequency queue
   Separate processes into multiple ready queues based on their need for the processor.
   Give preference to processes with short CPU bursts

*** Terms ***
finish_time - Arrival_time = Turnaround time (Whole process completes)
First_starts_running - Arrival time = Response time (How fast processes are started)
